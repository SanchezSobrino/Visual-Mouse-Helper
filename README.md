Visual Mouse Helper
===================

![Sample screencast][gif]
Visual Mouse Helper are two little filled circled that follows the mouse and stays on top
of any application whatever it happens.

You can get the last release from here: [download][bin]

Settings
========

You can bring out the settings window by focusing the main window clicking on the taskbar icon and
then pressing RETURN. There you may configure the colours, flashing delay and other stuff like
circle positions and an offset relative to the cursor.

Purpose?
========

A friend of mine has some visual problems and he has some problems trying to follow the 
mouse pointer on the screen. So this little application tries to help to fight that problem
by trying to draw some simple figures which stand out on the screen, so the person with
such problems quickly may find the cursor.

I release it just hoping it will be helpful to other people with similar problems.
